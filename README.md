# FinalProjectShaders
This project is created to run on the glman program, created by Mike Bailey at Oregon State University. web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman 
This is my final project for my shaders class. web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs519/

This program uses vertex shaders to morph the globe to have peaks and a flat sea. The fragment shader bump maps the ocean to make it appear like it is moving. The displacement and coloring are dependent on a Timer, so the object "evolves" into a planet over time
